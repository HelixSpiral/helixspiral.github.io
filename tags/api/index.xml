      <title>Automated certificate management in local Kubernetes clusters, with local domains</title>

      <description>Overview / Requirements / Setup After setting up external-dns and cert-manager for the hundreth time I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to add some functionality to my homelab cluster and have proper signed certs there. This blog post is a basic outline of how to setup cert-manager to sign certificates using a certificate and key provided from an intermediary CA.
I&amp;rsquo;m using pfSense to both provide DNS to my .lan domain and generate the root and intermediary CA certs, you can use whatever platform you&amp;rsquo;d like but the steps outlined here use pfSense.</description>

      <description>Overview Over the end of year 2023 Holidays I had a vacation and started working on revamping some tech for my chicken coop. This blog post is going to detail what we had initially, what I&amp;rsquo;m building, and some future ideas for the chicken tech.
Equipment/Software Used Original Helium Hotspot - Any official Helium Hotspot1 or home-built Data-Only2 hotspot will work SenseCAP 2103 (2)3 - LoRaWAN Temp, Humidity, and CO2 Sensor Raspberry PI 4b 8GB (2) - Local k8s cluster running in my home Helium Console4 - Helium Network console provided by the Helium Foundation, but any Helium-compatible console will work SenseCAP-Decoder5 - Javascript function for decoding 210X sensors provided by SenseCAP.</description>

      <description>Overview In this blog we&amp;rsquo;ll cover how the Astronomy Picture of the Day microservices are built and deployed with Docker and Kubernetes, and how to deploy the lightweight MQTT broker Mosquitto.
This is a follow up to my previous blog post System Scalability and Microservices with some additional information.

      <title>Ensuring backwards compatibility in deployments by leveraging git tags</title>

      <description>Overview I recently came across a blog post on injecting variables into Golang at build time and that gave me the idea for this blog post. Automating versioning and ensuring backwards compatibility.
GitHub repository and sample application You can find the code for this application here, on my GitHub
Git tags and versioning This blog post assumes some basic understanding of the git version control system. For anyone new to it you can probably get by with thinking that commits are incremental changes to the software and tags are user-created labels that reference a specific commit.</description>
