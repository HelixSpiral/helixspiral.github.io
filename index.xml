      <description>Overview Over the end of year 2023 Holidays I had a vacation and started working on revamping some tech for my chicken coop. This blog post is going to detail what we had initially, what I&amp;rsquo;m building, and some future ideas for the chicken tech.
Equipment/Software Used Original Helium Hotspot - Any official Helium Hotspot1 or home-built Data-Only2 hotspot will work SenseCAP 2103 (2)3 - LoRaWAN Temp, Humidity, and CO2 Sensor Raspberry PI 4b 8GB (2) - Local k8s cluster running in my home Helium Console4 - Helium Network console provided by the Helium Foundation, but any Helium-compatible console will work SenseCAP-Decoder5 - Javascript function for decoding 210X sensors provided by SenseCAP.</description>

      <description>Introduction As a member of an operations team you want things to be easy, you want things to &amp;ldquo;just work&amp;rdquo; the same way in a testing environment as they do in a production one. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll cover applications that need to be configured, and how to remove those needed configurations in favor of an application that &amp;ldquo;just works&amp;rdquo;.
Environment configurable Here is our example environment configurable application:
package main import ( &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;os&amp;#34; &amp;#34;github.</description>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been playing with some Rust projects, and one of the biggest struggles I had was getting a small platform agnostic Docker image that I could use to build any platform using docker buildx.
The code I wrote a very small program that spits out a random number along with the current architecture to use as an sample for our Docker work.
use rand::Rng; use current_platform::CURRENT_PLATFORM; fn main() { let mut rng = rand::thread_rng(); let r_num: u8 = rng.</description>

      <description>Overview In this blog we&amp;rsquo;ll cover how the Astronomy Picture of the Day microservices are built and deployed with Docker and Kubernetes, and how to deploy the lightweight MQTT broker Mosquitto.
This is a follow up to my previous blog post System Scalability and Microservices with some additional information.

      <title>Ensuring backwards compatibility in deployments by leveraging git tags</title>

      <guid>https://helixspiral.github.io/posts/2021-04-02-using-git-tags-to-ensure-deployment-backwards-compability/</guid>
      <description>Overview I recently came across a blog post on injecting variables into Golang at build time and that gave me the idea for this blog post. Automating versioning and ensuring backwards compatibility.
GitHub repository and sample application You can find the code for this application here, on my GitHub
Git tags and versioning This blog post assumes some basic understanding of the git version control system. For anyone new to it you can probably get by with thinking that commits are incremental changes to the software and tags are user-created labels that reference a specific commit.</description>

      <title>Automating Kubernetes with Saltstack</title>

      <guid>https://helixspiral.github.io/posts/2020-10-13-automating-kubernetes-with-saltstack/</guid>
      <description>Overview My goal for this project was to setup and manage a Kubernetes cluster using Saltstack, the idea being that since I wanted to learn them both if I could automate the setup of the cluster I&amp;rsquo;d be killing two birds with one stone.
I found a few good blog posts on this but all the ones I found lacked the level of automation I was looking for, some had hard coded values and others had manual commands needing to be run on the minions.</description>
