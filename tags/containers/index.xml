      <title>Automated certificate management in local Kubernetes clusters, with local domains</title>

      <description>Overview / Requirements / Setup After setting up external-dns and cert-manager for the hundreth time I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to add some functionality to my homelab cluster and have proper signed certs there. This blog post is a basic outline of how to setup cert-manager to sign certificates using a certificate and key provided from an intermediary CA.
I&amp;rsquo;m using pfSense to both provide DNS to my .lan domain and generate the root and intermediary CA certs, you can use whatever platform you&amp;rsquo;d like but the steps outlined here use pfSense.</description>

      <description>Overview Over the end of year 2023 Holidays I had a vacation and started working on revamping some tech for my chicken coop. This blog post is going to detail what we had initially, what I&amp;rsquo;m building, and some future ideas for the chicken tech.
Equipment/Software Used Original Helium Hotspot - Any official Helium Hotspot1 or home-built Data-Only2 hotspot will work SenseCAP 2103 (2)3 - LoRaWAN Temp, Humidity, and CO2 Sensor Raspberry PI 4b 8GB (2) - Local k8s cluster running in my home Helium Console4 - Helium Network console provided by the Helium Foundation, but any Helium-compatible console will work SenseCAP-Decoder5 - Javascript function for decoding 210X sensors provided by SenseCAP.</description>

      <title>Automating Kubernetes with Saltstack</title>

      <description>Overview My goal for this project was to setup and manage a Kubernetes cluster using Saltstack, the idea being that since I wanted to learn them both if I could automate the setup of the cluster I&amp;rsquo;d be killing two birds with one stone.
I found a few good blog posts on this but all the ones I found lacked the level of automation I was looking for, some had hard coded values and others had manual commands needing to be run on the minions.</description>
